# Title Lookup

Users land on a homepage with a search form where they type in the name of the title they are searching for. They may type it out fully themselves or an autocomplete dropdown will appear and they may also select from that. Once they search for their title they will be taken to an info page for the title where they can expand sections by clicking on the headers of those sections.
